My project at Yale Hacks (Explo at Yale 2016)

I made this website at the seven-hour-long Yale Hacks where our project was to design a tourism website for a fictitious travel company in our hometown using Bootstrap. We were given a thorough overview of HTML, basic javascript and Bootstrap and I used the provided documentation for guidance. Some of the features I used were a Google Maps widget with pre-programmed directions, a photo carousel and popup viewer.
